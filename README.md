# Cherenkov-Radiation-Python
This code calculates and plots the Cherenkov radiation spectrum in water using the Frank-Tamm formula. The formula takes into account the speed of a charged particle and the refractive index of the medium to calculate the intensity of the radiation. The resulting spectra are plotted using matplotlib.
